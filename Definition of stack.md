# Stack-Queue
A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements. Â 
It has two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. 
The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out). 
Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
