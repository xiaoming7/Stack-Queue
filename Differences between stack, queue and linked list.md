A stack allows only add or remove an item which is on top of a stack, a queue only allows add from the rear poin and delete from the front point, but we can insert or remove a node at any position of a linked list. 
Order: the stack follows LIFO (Last In First Out); the queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure.
